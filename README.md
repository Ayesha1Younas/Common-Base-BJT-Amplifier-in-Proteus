# Common-Base-BJT-Amplifier-in-Proteus
Project of Common Base BJT Amplifier in Proteus
This project is about the type of amplifier that uses a Bipolar Junction Transistor for amplification. The BJTis set in such a way that base is common to emmiter and collector terminal. You can check more projects by clicking www.theengineeringprojects.com .
